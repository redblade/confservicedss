"Github flow" is used for source code versioning https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
Source code is tagged with major.minor.change (eg. 0.1.2)

A script, change_version.sh, is used to make the changes to the code to reflect the version
Docker image is built by Jenkins and versioned as major.minor.change_build, where build is changed automatically

Changes are described in changelog, that also stores a reference to the JHipster data model version used

change_version.sh changes the major.minor.change version in:

package.json
pom.xml
Jenkinsfile
../custom_configuration/confservice-deployment.yml
../src/main/resources/config/application.yml
